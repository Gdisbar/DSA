DIEHARD - DIE HARD
=======================
// The game is simple. You initially have âHâ amount of health 
// and âAâ amount of armor. At any instant you can live in any of the three 
// places - fire, water and air. After every unit time, you have to change 
// your place of living. For example if you are currently living at fire, 
// you can either step into water or air.

// If you step into air, your health increases by 3 and your armor increases by 2

// If you step into water, your health decreases by 5 and your armor decreases by 10

// If you step into fire, your health decreases by 20 and your armor increases by 5

// If your health or armor becomes <=0, you will die instantly

// Find the maximum time you can survive.

// Input:

// The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. 
// For each test case there will be two positive integers representing the 
// initial health H and initial armor A.


// Output:

// For each test case find the maximum time you can survive.

 

// Note: You can choose any of the 3 places during your first move.

 

// Input Constraints:

// 1 <= t <= 10
// 1 <= H, A <= 1000

// Example:

// Sample Input:

// 3
// 2 10
// 4 4
// 20 8

// Sample Output:

// 1
// 1
// 5
