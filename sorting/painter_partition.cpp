Painter''s Partition Problem
===============================

// Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integars C of size N.

// Element C[i] represents length of ith board.

// You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 … CN-1]. There are A 
// painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 
// 1 unit of board.

// Calculate and return minimum time required to paint all boards under the 
// constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

//         2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
//         cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
//         A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
//         configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
//         invalid.

// Return the ans % 10000003




// Input Format

// The first argument given is the integer A.
// The second argument given is the integer B.
// The third argument given is the integer array C.

// Output Format

// Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any 
// painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.

// Constraints

// 1 <=A <= 1000
// 1 <= B <= 10^6
// 1 <= C.size() <= 10^5
// 1 <= C[i] <= 10^6

// For Example

// Input 1:
//     A = 2
//     B = 5
//     C = [1, 10]
// Output 1:
//     50
// Explanation 1:
//     Possibility 1:- same painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units
//     Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, 
//     time take = max(5, 50) = 50
//     There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
//     ans = 50%10000003

// Input 2:
//     A = 10
//     B = 1
//     C = [1, 8, 11, 3]
// Output 2:
//     11
