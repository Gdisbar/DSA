Johnson''s Algorithm
========================
// Johnson's Algorithm uses both Dijkstra''s Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm. 
// Johnson's Algorithm can find the all pair shortest path even in the case of 
// the negatively weighted graphs. It uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm in order to 
// eliminate negative edges by using the technique of reweighting the given graph 
// and detecting the negative cycles.

// This problem of finding the all pair shortest path can also be solved using 
// Floyd warshall Algorithm but the Time complexity of the Floyd warshall 
// algorithm is O(V^3), which is a polynomial-time algorithm, on the other hand, 
// the Time complexity of Johnsonâ€™s Algorithm is O(v^2log(V + ElogV) which is much 
// more efficient than the Floyd warshall Algorithm.

// The working of Johnson''s Algorithm can be easily understood by dividing the 
// algorithm into three major parts which are as follows

// To calculate the shortest path between every pair of vertices the idea is 
// to add a base vertex (vertex SSS in figure below) that is directly connected 
// to every vertex. In other words, the cost to reach each vertex from the newly 
// added base vertex SSS is zero. Since at this stage our graph contains 
// negative weight edges so we apply the Bellman-Ford Algorithm.

// Reweighting of the edges is done because of the fact that if the 
// weight of all the edges in a given graph G are non negative, we can find the 
// shortest paths between all pairs of vertices just by running Dijkstra''s 
// Algorithm once from each vertex which is more efficient than applying the 
// Bellman-Ford algorithm.
