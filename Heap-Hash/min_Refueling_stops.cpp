871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops
=======================================
// A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles 
// east of the starting position.

// There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as 
// an array stations where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that 
// the ith gas station is positioni miles east of the starting position and has 
// fueli liters of gas.

// The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel 
// liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. 
// When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all 
// the gas from the station into the car.

// Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to 
// reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.

// Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still 
// refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is 
// still considered to have arrived.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
// Output: 0
// Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.

// Example 2:

// Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
// Output: -1
// Explanation: We can not reach the target (or even the first gas station).

// Example 3:

// Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],
//      [60,40]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: We start with 10 liters of fuel.
// We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters 
// to 60 liters of gas.
// Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
// and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the 
// target.We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.



//  TC : O(Nlog‚Å°N), where N is the length of stations.

//  SC : O(N), the space used by pq.

//     then we can refuel: dp[t + 1] = max(dp[t + 1], dp[t] + s[i][1])
